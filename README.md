# Digital Publishing Specialist Candidate Test

Please answer the following questions to the best of your abilities. Feel free to use any references/documentation available on the internet to complete this test.

Please note that we are just as interested in the problem-solving processes with which you approach these exercises as we are in your solutions. If you get stuck on any of these questions, please indicate the steps you took, the point at which you encountered difficulties, and what further action you think would be needed to complete the task.

Please create a file containing your answers and send it along with the files you create for Exercises 2 and 4.

## Exercise 1

Create a GitHub account if you don’t already have one. Clone down this repo, checkout a new branch, commit a change to the file _exercise1/this\_is\_a\_test.asciidoc_ in your branch (you can change anything you’d like), push your branch to GitHub, and submit a pull request.

## Exercise 2

Make a copy of the files located in the _exercise2_ directory. Based on the output in _epub\_build\_log.txt_ and _pdf\_build\_log.txt_, make changes to the Asciidoc files to fix the indicated errors.

## Exercise 3

The Tools team received the following question regarding AsciiDoc markup from an O’Reilly author:

> From: Tobias Featherbottom <tobias@featherbottom.uk> \
> To: O’Reilly Tools Team <toolsreq@oreilly.com> \
> Subject: Images with alt text in AsciiDoc 
> 
> Hi Tools,
> 
> I’m interested in including formal images with titles and alt text in my manuscript. In HTML, one of these images would look like this:
> ```
> <figure>
> <img src="images/hello_world.png" alt="Hello World">
> <figcaption>Hello World</figcaption>
> </figure>
> ```
>
> But I’m not sure what markup to use in AsciiDoc. Could you advise?
> 
> Thanks, \
> Tobias

Using the [Atlas AsciiDoc documentation](https://docs.atlas.oreilly.com/writing_in_asciidoc.html) as a reference, please write an email response to Tobias that answers his question.

## Exercise 4

Make a copy of and modify the XSL file located at _exercise4/sample.xsl_ so that it removes all `<span>` elements with no attributes and transforms all `<b>` elements to `<strong>` elements in a target HTML file.

## Exercise 5

In 140 characters or less, please tell us why you’re interested in joining the O’Reilly Tools team.
